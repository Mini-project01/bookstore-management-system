<b> ABSTRACT </b> <br>
Nothing can beat the feeling of reading a book at a library. Library will always be the most important platform 
supporting books. But there are many instances where we cannot visit the library. Amidst the Covid crisis we 
most of us could not visit the library. And even if there is no Covid there are people who do not have a library 
in their vicinity or many a times they do not have the time to visit the library. In such cases an online book 
store serves as a great medium between people and books. Also in the present system user and admin have to 
do all the work manually. During issuing order of more stock, the project register is required to check to 
availability of stock in hand and it takes time to check records. In the present system to generate the reports 
based on the management requirement, extensive searching of records is needed. Online bookstore also 
solves these issues and makes keeping record of data very easy.

<b> Flow Of The Project: </b> <br> 
→ The user first needs to create an account. <br>
→ After successfully creating an account the user can browse through various books category wise. <br>
→ There will be 2 main categories: Free books and paid books. <br>
→ In free books section the user can download the pdf of the books available in the free category. <br>
→ In the paid section there are 2 options: The user can pay and download the pdf or the user can ask for
 doorstep delivery book(hardcopy). <br>
→ In case the user opts for the paid books the user will be directed to an online payment portal where the user needs to enter their card details. <br>
→ Once the transaction is made the user will be able to get the pdf file as soon as possible but if the user has opted to get the hard copy of the book , the delivery of the book will take the required time depending on the location of the user. <br>
→ A record will also be maintained of the books purchased/downloaded by the user. <br>
→ There will also be a record of the books in and out of stock. <br>
→ One can also sell books on this platform. <br>
→ There can be 2 categories for selling books: New and unused books and second hand books. <br>
